# Measuring the temporal dynamics of inter-personal neural entrainment in continuous child-adult EEG hyperscanning data

If you use any of the code for your research, then we would appreciate your including the following reference to the program in the papers in which you publish your results:

Haresign, I. M., Phillips, E., Whitehorn, M., Goupil, L., Noreika, V., Leong, V., & Wass, S. V. (2022). Measuring the temporal dynamics of inter-personal neural entrainment in continuous child-adult EEG hyperscanning data. Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 101093.

This collection of scripts was set up for the purpose of allowing users to compute various time-frequency entrainment metrics on dual EEG (see paper for further details). A good place to start is the tutorial section which gives a basic overview and implementation of the functions that compute the various entrainment.

BELOW IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE CODE:

The code is organised into four sections. Inside each folder you can find a detailed description of what each function does and how to use it.

1.	The ‘Main_funcs’ folder contains all of the main functions that were presented within the paper.

2.	The ‘Sample data’ folder contains a fully pre-processed/cleaned parent-child EEG hyperscanning dataset.

3.	The ‘Simulations’ folder contains the scripts/ functions that we used to generate the simulated data that was used in the paper to test the various entrainment analysis.

4.	The ‘Tutorials’ folder contains the example scripts that guide the user in implementing the various analysis/ functions contained within the Main_funcs folder.
