Collection of MATLAB code accompanying “Using dual EEG to analyse event-locked changes in child-adult neural connectivity”.

See Haresign, I. M., Phillips, E., Whitehorn, M., Goupil, L., & Wass, S. V. (2021). Using dual EEG to analyse event-locked changes in child-adult neural connectivity. bioRxiv.

This collection of scripts was set up for the purpose of allowing users to compute various time-frequency connectivity metrics on dual EEG (see paper for further details).

A good place to start is the tutorial section which gives a basic overview and implementation of the functions that compute the various connectivity measure (these can all be found within the main functions folder).

See also the simulations folder for the code that was used in the accompanying paper for the various simulations and figures.
